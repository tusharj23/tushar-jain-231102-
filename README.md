a)Procedure:
1)Visualizing Data to get a idea to use one hot encoding, replacing missing values etc.
2)Preprocessing the data :
i)removing the columns which have null values greater than 50%
ii)Using mode and mean  for features having non-integer entries and integer entries respectively.
iii)#checking the heat map to get the count of null values 
3)Converting columns with object data into One-Hot Encoded data
4)Applying KNN
5)Clustering
6)Gradio
b)CSV files used for gradio :
1)train.csv
2)gradio_tain2.csv:Selecting most appropriate five features by taking reference from heatmap
3)gradio_test.csv:Selecting most appropriate five features by taking reference from heatmap
C)House prices knn output : File generated by computer after applying knn regression .
